# Elm-starter

Another simple elm project starter scaffold.

## Getting Started

This repo is my private elm project scaffold with
a manual router. I will update as I progress my elm knowledge.

It contains basic stuff to get you started, and a simple backend
using json-server.

### Prerequisites

Installed node, npm, yarn and elm.

## Installation

```js
yarn && elm-package install
```

## Contributing

If you have any ideas about extending the project post a pull request and
I'll definitely take a look at it.
